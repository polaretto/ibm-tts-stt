      Today we donâ€™t care about how implicit ratings have been collected. We will assume that someone is giving us implicit ratings that mean that the user probably likes this items.

      Normally implicit ratings are in a scale from zero to one.<break strength="x-weak"></break> Zero means you have no information. One means the user did something with the product which we assume that certifies that the user likes it.

      From now on, we are assuming that our recommender system has either explicit or implicit ratings even if, normally, a real recommender system has both.

      This choice has been made because creating an algorithm which can manage both explicit and implicit ratings is not much difficult, but requires to consider a lot of technical details which are not interesting here. Some of the algorithms we use can work only with implicit ratings while other arguments are better designed for implicit ratings.
